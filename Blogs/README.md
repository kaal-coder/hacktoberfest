Web3 is the latest policy speak nowadays we often see.
But What does it actually mean?
There is a lot of definitions have been thrown around. we generally think of Web3 as a trustless, permissionless, and decentralized internet that leverages blockchain technology.
Web3â€™s defining feature is ownership. Whereas the first iteration of the commercial internet (Web1) was read-only for most users, and Web2 allowed users to both reads & write on centralized platforms (Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, etc)
Web3 gives users full ownership over their content, data, and assets via blockchains. It empowers users to read-write-own. Where a third party like Facebook owns your identity and data in Web2.
your identity in Web3 can move fluidly between platforms without your data being captured and monetized by service providers.
While Web2 apps are centrally controlled, tokens in Web3 grant users the right to help govern the services they use representing a form of ownership in the platforms themselves.
Some illustrations to easily understand.
I can send money to my loved ones or family overseas ostensibly paying over 10% in fees and getting cheated by criminally convicted
What's more, no corporation can deplatform me or censor the transfers of value to my family
As a philanthropist, I can donate to charities I want to fund anonymously, without fear of having my data sold and being profiled by other charities or being outed in public and exposing myself as a "generous donor," which might expose my family to scams. 
As a non-US person, I never had the ability to invest in US stocks. This prevents billions of people from participating in the largest capital markets in the world and achieving financial freedom and independence. Web3 allows me to finally own US stocks 
For me, the main thing about web3 is that it is trustless therefore nobody but myself is holding my personal data. I can also contribute to web3 by selling bandwidth and storage space to decentralized open-source projects
